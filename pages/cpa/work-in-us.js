            <p>Master&#39;s in Finance/Accounting courses are usually categorised as non-STEM courses
              and offer only a one-year work permit. However, Simandhar has collaborated with
              US university partners that have incorporated Business Analytics into its Master&#39;s in
              Finance/Accounting programs, which have now been classified as STEM programs
              (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). As a result, graduates of these
              programs from Simandhar are now eligible for a three-year work permit (OPT). This
              in turn creates a large talent pool of US CPAs which will then take care of the main
              problem statement of the acute shortage of accountants. (As per the 2021 AICPA
              report).</p>

                    <p>The Simandhar career pathway is pretty simple and direct, without any confusion. Aspiring students who are already enrolled or planning to enroll in the CPA course at Simandhar are now entitled to get complete guidance to pursue their MS or Master's degree in the United States. There are certain accredited programs and STEM-designated MS degree programs that are being offered in accounting and finance streams. So students can choose this path in order to get a qualified Master's degree in the US and also have the opportunity to study CPA in parallel and appear for the exams there. Most of the MS degree programs, such as MSA-MS in Accounting, also cover CPA subjects. This provides enhanced CPA prep, and they also get to learn some of the latest data analytics, accounting analytics, etc. This not only voids the heavy international fees, but aspirants can now get complete eligibility to appear for the CPA exam and/or get their license. In order for them to get a license, candidates should have practical, consecutive work experience. This can come in the form of an OPT after they graduate from their MS program. The above diagram illustrates the career pathway in detail.</p>

                    <p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It is an acronym used by federal and state governments in the US to categorize and group together fields of study and career paths that are centered on the above four disciplines. STEM education and careers are characterized by their emphasis on problem-solving, critical thinking, innovation, and the application of scientific, technological, and mathematical principles to real-world problems and scenarios.</p>

                      <p>Simandhar's main aim is to impart high-quality education and give them placement opportunities. We believe that education has the ability to transform every individual. Today's students donâ€™t just need information to be educated; they need an overall transformation to be successful in life. Since CPA is conducted by the AICPA in the US and has immense benefits, Simandhar is creating a pathway for aspiring students to clear their exam and even get their certification and licensing. The licensing for US CPAs could come from any state board in the US. Similarly, ACCA has benefits in the UK and India. Similarly, CPA Australia or CPA Canada have immense benefits for people who are in these regions. Hence, Simandhar strives to open new frontiers of education anywhere abroad. Moreover, US CPA is globally recognized and can land your dream job anywhere.</p>

                  <Accordion.Body className="faq-box">
                    <p>There are countless reasons why you should consider going to the US.
Firstly, the United States is undoubtedly the number one destination for education in STEM fields. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) With state-of-the-art educational infrastructure, facilities, and educational environment, learning from faculty who are among the finest in the world, not to mention the practical training and exposure that you get, is unmatched. This is why so many people, from China to India, flock to the US every year for education. This also brings in many other benefits, such as achieving financial stability, expanding your career prospects, exploring global opportunities and research, and, of course, upskilling yourself with the latest technological advancements. What more do you need?</p>

                  <Accordion.Body className="faq-box">
                    <p>Yes, surely you can. Since you are going on an F1 student visa when you go for your higher studies in the US, your dependents can go on an F2 visa. You may have to show proof of funds that are adequate for both dependents. There will be additional living expenses that the student on F1 would incur (for dependents) while studying. To name a few, housing, health insurance, living expenses, food, medicines, possible day care costs, etc.)</p>

                    <p>Yes, you can definitely do that. It depends on the skills, goals, and needs of the CA student. A CA student can decide to make a quick transition to pursue his MS degree program and parally prepare for CPA and clear that easily. Since 70% of the CPA course is taught while pursuing Indian CA, it is quite easy for CA students to crack US CPA. Moreover, the MS in Accounting also covers a lot of topics in the curriculum related to CPA and prepares them to be eligible to take the exam there.</p>

                    <p>Simandhar highly recommends passing at least one exam in India before commencing your Masters in Accounting program in the US. This not only gives you a sense of achievement but also enables you to dedicate more time towards enhancing your career prospects. However, we have seen many students who are qualified working professionals or candidates with good fundamental concepts (after learning CA inter or CA final) breeze through and prepare for and clear the US CPA exams while pursuing their Masters. This will save time and enhance career opportunities and placements.</p>

                    For B.Com students, it opens a new path to pursue their Masters. 15 years of education may be accepted, but again, it depends on the university selection. CPA alone is not the only reason for getting a job in the USA. The STEM program also aids in landing jobs, and you also get the all-important VISA extension for up to 3 years. You can also opt for the important practical training and work experience that you get. (during your OPT period). Furthermore, you also have a higher Master's degree from an accredited university in the USA. This degree itself can make an impact in getting a job and the work permit; however, CPA does increase the placement chances and will count as evidence of professional accounting success.</p>

                    <p>At Simandhar Education, we often say "if CPA is your Passport, MAcc is your VISA." This is because by obtaining your MAcc, you can secure a 3-year work OPT and gain access to job opportunities in the US, making it a guaranteed pathway for a career in the US.</p>
