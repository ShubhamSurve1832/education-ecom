                {/* <p className='about-title'>The root causes</p> */}
                <p>The CPA Evolution initiative has been taken into consideration as it modernizes the CPA licensure model to highlight the skills and competencies needed to practice accounting today and in the near future. Evolution introduces a new CPA Exam that tests a particular skill set required by all the candidates, as well as a chosen Discipline in which they can demonstrate their skills and knowledge in detail. The new CPA Exam will still be 16 hours long and will be divided into four sections, three core and one discipline.</p>

              <div>
                <p className='about-title'>The background</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The AICPA and NASBA announced an initiative in June 2019 to update the CPA Exam to meet the increasing demands placed on newly-licensed CPAs.</li>
                  <li>The NASBA Board of Directors unanimously approved the CPA Evolution initiative on July 27, 2020.</li>
                  <li>In May 2020, the AICPA's Governing Council enthusiastically supported the initiative.</li>
                  <li>The AICPA started working with academia in 2021 to ensure that students are well prepared for changes in education requirements when they are implemented.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className='heading03'>What is the need of CPA Evolution/Changes 2024?</h3>
              <p>The unique "CORE plus Discipline" framework is intended to demonstrate that CPAs have the in-depth knowledge required to perform professional requirement. This also demonstrates the reality of most methods that concentrate on a single important area of accounting instead of all of them simultaneously. This model will enable the AICPA to easily include or exclude Disciplines in order to accurately recognise practice as it evolves.</p>
              <p>Irrespective of which discipline a candidate tests in, once they obtain their CPA licence, they will be able to practice in any area.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className='heading03'>When will the CPA Evolution take place?</h3>
              <p>The new CPA Exam will be available on January 10, 2024. That is when you will be able to take segments of the new and improved CPA Exam pattern.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 className='heading03'>2024 CPA sneak-peek!</h3>
              <p>The existing AUD, FAR, and REG segments will be renamed "Core," and all candidates will be required to pass them in order to pass the CPA Exam. The current BEC section, on the other hand, is being phased out. Candidates will choose one of three new "Discipline" sections to demonstrate deeper skills and knowledge in place of BEC.</p>
              <p>The new CPA Exam Discipline sections are as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Business Analysis and Reporting (BAR)</li>
                <li>Information Systems and Controls (ISC)</li>
                <li>Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The management of the new CPA Exam is anticipated to remain largely unchanged: it will still take the same 16 hours as it does now and will be divided into four sections.</p>
              <p>Accounting students should be aware of the exam's educational requirements. They have not yet changed, but in June 2021, a new model for an accounting curriculum in line with the CPA Evolution updates was unveiled.</p>
              <p>We recommend that candidates complete their CPA studies as soon as possible to avoid having to account for these changes.</p>

              <h3 className='heading03'>Things to know about 2024 CPA Exam</h3>
              <p>The AICPA released an Exposure Draft (ED) containing tentative CPA Evolution Blueprints for public comment on June 28, 2022, giving the public their first look at the content coming to the CPA Exam in 2024.</p>

              <p>In addition to the draught Uniform CPA Examination Blueprints, the ED presents the findings and conclusions of the AICPA's Practice Analysis, which was used to draught the blueprints and was overseen by the Board of Examiners.</p>

              <p>The Practice Analysis was designed to identify the technical knowledge and critical skills required of newly licensed CPAs, so the Evolution Blueprint draught is the first look at how the new CPA Exam is addressing the accounting skills gap and ensuring the CPA Certification remains the gold standard in the accounting world.</p>

              <p>The Evolution blueprints include not only the content (represented by representative task statements for each exam section), but also the proposed number of questions, how the AICPA intends to weight the content on the new CPA Exam, and the critical skills assigned for testing on each exam section.</p>
