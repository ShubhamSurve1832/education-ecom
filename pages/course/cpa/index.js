The CPA aspirants can take the exam sections without restrictions, other than waiting to receive scores from prior attempts of the same section or a major change to the exam. Continuous Testing will replace the existing limited CPA Exam Testing Window model, which only permits candidates to test in India during designated time frames.

        The 55 U.S. Accountancy Boards support the move to continuous testing in India. This shift to a continuous testing model in India signifies the power of alignment among state boards, NASBA, AICPA and Prometric as these organizations continue to support Exam candidates on their journey to CPA. Candidates are asked to visit the NASBA's website to confirm that their Accountancy Board has transitioned to the Continuous Testing model.

        Exam Locations: In India, the CPA exam will happen in Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata and Trivandrum."

As opposed to accountants, only CPAs can perform mandatory audits for publicly traded U.S. companies.An accountant is a practitioner who engages in accounting through preparation and audit of financial statements, bookkeeping, and financial analysis. Accountants are a level up from bookkeepers. They can (but usually don\'t) perform bookkeeping functions.
