As you may know, the previous rule in Nasba no longer applies. B.Com students will receive 90 credits, and they will need to complete a mandatory bridge course to reach 120 credits and be eligible for the CPA exam. Due to the difference in education systems between India (15 years) and the US (16 years), this bridge course is necessary as Nasba doesn't follow the NAAC A rule. Simandhar Education has partnered with Silver Oak University for this opportunity.</p>
