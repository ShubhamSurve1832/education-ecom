                      A few state boards of US have an MoU with the ICAI which allows the chartered accountants to take the US CPA exam without pursuing any additional degree in accounting, commerce or other streams, which are usually required for non-CA’s. India CA and US CPA are similar in a few ways,as they both deal with professional accountancy. However, there are a few distinct differences between the two.
